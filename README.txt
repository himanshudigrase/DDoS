Folder contains two .ipynb files
1. final.ipynb
2. trainingmodels.ipynb
3. DDoS report

*******************Only file needs to run is final.ipynb*****************


trainingmodels.ipynb contains all models which have been tried on the data with hyperparameter tuning. 
All the best parameters have been implemented in final.ipynb file for each model. SO no need to run trainingmodels.ipynb file again.Only file which needs to be run is final.ipynb which contains model giving best score



Thanks!!!
